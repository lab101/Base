# BASIC CINDER BLOCK
Basic set of code when starting a new Cinder project.
Could be usefull for other people but very specific to my workflow.
- sets the screen with MSAA, adds prepare settings
- lightweight settingstweaker.
- log notifications to screen and log files.


Use *copy* when installing the block so the GlobalSettings don't get cluttered over other projects
